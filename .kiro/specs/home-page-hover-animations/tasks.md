# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add CSS custom properties for hover animation values








  - Define CSS variables for hover scale, translate, glow opacity, brightness, and timing values in hero-wordmark.css
  - Include reduced motion fallback variables that disable scaling and movement
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.1, 4.2_


- [x] 2. Implement hover transitions for the SciCo title








  - Add transition properties to .hero-wordmark__title for transform, text-shadow, and filter
  - Ensure transitions don't interfere with existing intro animation timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.2_
-


- [x] 3. Add hover state styles for the SciCo title




  - Implement :hover pseudo-class with 1.05x scale, translateY(-2px), and enhanced glow effects
  - Add additional outer glow shadow with rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.3) at 32px blur
  - Include will-change optimization for performance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Implement hover transitions for the tagline





  - Add transition properties to .hero-wordmark__tagline for filter and text-shadow
  - Ensure shimmer underline effect timing is preserved during hover interactions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Add hover state styles for the tagline





  - Implement :hover pseudo-class with brightness(1.2) filter and enhanced text shadow
  - Increase existing text shadow opacity by 30% while maintaining current shadow structure
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Implement reduced motion accessibility support





  - Add @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) query that overrides hover animations
  - Provide alternative hover effects using only color/brightness changes for accessibility
  - Ensure reduced motion variables disable scaling and transform animations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Add focus state support for keyboard navigation









  - Apply hover effects to :focus pseudo-class for both title and tagline
  - Ensure keyboard users get the same interactive feedback as mouse users
  - Maintain existing focus indicators and accessibility structure
  - _Requirements: 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Test and validate hover animation performance
















  - Verify animations use hardware acceleration with transform3d and translateZ(0)
  - Confirm 60fps performance during hover interactions
  - Test that existing intro animations are not affected by hover implementation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
