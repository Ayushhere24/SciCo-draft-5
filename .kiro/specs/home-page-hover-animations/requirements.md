# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the home page user experience by adding smooth, engaging hover animations to the logo and main heading elements. The goal is to create a more interactive and polished feel while maintaining the existing visual design and accessibility standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the main logo and heading to respond smoothly to my mouse interactions, so that the interface feels more engaging and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over the main "SciCo" title THEN the system SHALL display a smooth scaling animation with enhanced glow effects
2. WHEN a user moves their mouse away from the title THEN the system SHALL smoothly return to the original state
3. WHEN hover animations are active THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and accessibility
4. IF a user has reduced motion preferences enabled THEN the system SHALL provide subtle alternative effects that respect accessibility needs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the tagline "Where Obsession Wins" to have subtle interactive feedback, so that the overall experience feels cohesive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over the tagline THEN the system SHALL display a gentle brightness increase and enhanced text shadow
2. WHEN the tagline is hovered THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing shimmer underline effect timing
3. WHEN animations occur THEN the system SHALL use smooth easing functions for natural movement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the hover animations to be performant and not impact existing functionality, so that the website remains fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hover animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and opacity for optimal performance
2. WHEN animations run THEN the system SHALL NOT interfere with existing intro animations or transitions
3. WHEN the code is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing component structure and props
4. IF performance is measured THEN the system SHALL show no significant impact on rendering performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want hover animations to respect my motion preferences, so that I can comfortably use the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has "prefers-reduced-motion" enabled THEN the system SHALL provide alternative hover effects using color/brightness changes only
2. WHEN reduced motion is active THEN the system SHALL maintain visual feedback without scale or transform animations
3. WHEN accessibility features are active THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing ARIA labels and semantic structure
