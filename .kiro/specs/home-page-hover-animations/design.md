# Design Document: Home Page Hover Animations

## Overview

This design implements smooth, engaging hover animations for the main "SciCo" title and "Where Obsession Wins" tagline on the home page. The solution enhances user interaction while maintaining accessibility standards and performance optimization. The design leverages CSS transforms and transitions for optimal performance, with fallback behaviors for users with reduced motion preferences.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
The hover animations will be implemented within the existing `HeroWordmark` component (`src/components/HeroWordmark.tsx`) without breaking changes to the component API or existing functionality. The animations will be purely additive, enhancing the current intro animations rather than replacing them.

### Technology Stack
- **CSS Transforms & Transitions**: Primary animation mechanism for optimal performance
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For dynamic hover state values and easy maintenance
- **Media Queries**: For reduced motion accessibility compliance
- **React State Management**: Minimal state for hover tracking if needed for complex interactions

### Animation Timing
- **Hover In**: 200ms duration with `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)` easing
- **Hover Out**: 300ms duration with `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)` easing
- **Reduced Motion**: Instant transitions (0ms) or subtle opacity-only effects

## Components and Interfaces

### HeroWordmark Component Enhancements

#### CSS Class Structure
```css
.hero-wordmark__title {
  /* Existing styles preserved */
  /* New hover transition properties */
}

.hero-wordmark__title:hover {
  /* Hover state styles */
}

.hero-wordmark__tagline {
  /* Existing styles preserved */
  /* New hover transition properties */
}

.hero-wordmark__tagline:hover {
  /* Hover state styles */
}
```

#### Hover State Specifications

**SciCo Title Hover Effects:**
- Scale: 1.05x (5% increase)
- Enhanced glow: Increase existing text-shadow opacity by 50%
- Additional outer glow: `0 0 32px rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.3)`
- Subtle lift: `translateY(-2px)`

**Tagline Hover Effects:**
- Brightness increase: `filter: brightness(1.2)`
- Enhanced text shadow: Increase existing shadow opacity by 30%
- Preserve existing shimmer underline timing and behavior

### Performance Optimizations

#### CSS Properties Used
- `transform`: Hardware-accelerated scaling and translation
- `text-shadow`: Enhanced glow effects
- `filter`: Brightness adjustments for tagline
- `transition`: Smooth state changes

#### Will-Change Optimization
```css
.hero-wordmark__title:hover,
.hero-wordmark__tagline:hover {
  will-change: transform, text-shadow, filter;
}
```

## Data Models

### CSS Custom Properties
```css
:root {
  --hover-scale-title: 1.05;
  --hover-translate-y: -2px;
  --hover-glow-opacity: 0.45; /* 50% increase from base 0.3 */
  --hover-brightness: 1.2;
  --hover-duration-in: 200ms;
  --hover-duration-out: 300ms;
  --hover-easing: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
}
```

### Reduced Motion Variables
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  :root {
    --hover-scale-title: 1.0; /* No scaling */
    --hover-translate-y: 0px; /* No movement */
    --hover-duration-in: 0ms; /* Instant */
    --hover-duration-out: 0ms; /* Instant */
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Complete fallback with alternative hover effects using only color/brightness changes
- **Focus States**: Preserve existing focus indicators and add hover effects to focus states
- **ARIA Preservation**: Maintain all existing ARIA labels and semantic structure
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure hover effects also apply to keyboard focus states

### Performance Safeguards
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use `transform3d()` and `translateZ(0)` for hardware acceleration
- **Transition Optimization**: Limit transitions to transform and opacity properties
- **Memory Management**: Avoid creating new DOM elements during hover states

### Browser Compatibility
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation for older browsers without CSS transform support
- **Vendor Prefixes**: Include necessary prefixes for broader compatibility
- **Feature Detection**: Use `@supports` queries for advanced features

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
1. **Hover State Verification**: Confirm smooth scaling and glow effects on title
2. **Tagline Interaction**: Verify brightness increase and shadow enhancement
3. **Animation Timing**: Validate 200ms hover-in and 300ms hover-out durations
4. **Shimmer Preservation**: Ensure existing tagline shimmer effect remains intact

### Accessibility Testing
1. **Reduced Motion Compliance**: Test with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify hover effects apply to keyboard focus
3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensure animations don't interfere with assistive technology
4. **High Contrast Mode**: Verify visibility in high contrast display modes

### Performance Testing
1. **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Ensure 60fps during hover animations
2. **CPU Usage**: Monitor for performance impact during animations
3. **Memory Consumption**: Verify no memory leaks from repeated hover interactions
4. **Mobile Performance**: Test on lower-powered mobile devices

### Cross-Browser Testing
1. **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
2. **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
3. **Reduced Motion Support**: Test across different browser implementations
4. **Hardware Acceleration**: Verify GPU acceleration is working correctly

### Integration Testing
1. **Intro Animation Compatibility**: Ensure hover animations don't conflict with existing intro sequences
2. **Component Props**: Verify `introComplete` prop doesn't affect hover behavior
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Test hover effects across different screen sizes
4. **State Management**: Confirm hover states reset properly on component unmount

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions and Rationales

**CSS-Only Approach**: Using pure CSS for animations ensures optimal performance and reduces JavaScript bundle size. CSS transforms are hardware-accelerated and provide smoother animations than JavaScript-based solutions.

**Preserve Existing Structure**: The design maintains the current component architecture and styling approach, ensuring no breaking changes to existing functionality or visual design.

**Accessibility-First**: The reduced motion implementation provides meaningful alternative effects (brightness/color changes) rather than simply disabling animations, ensuring all users have engaging interactions.

**Performance Priority**: Using `transform` and `opacity` properties ensures animations run on the GPU compositor thread, preventing main thread blocking and maintaining smooth performance.

**Subtle Enhancement**: The hover effects are designed to feel natural and enhance the existing visual hierarchy without being distracting or overwhelming.

### Technical Constraints

- Must not interfere with existing intro animations
- Must maintain current responsive behavior
- Must preserve all existing ARIA labels and semantic structure
- Must work within the current CSS architecture and naming conventions
- Must be compatible with the existing Spectral font family and text-shadow effects
