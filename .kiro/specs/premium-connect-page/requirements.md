# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a premium Connect section to the existing SciCo single-page website that provides two main interaction points for users: Contact Us and Join Us. The section will be positioned after the existing podcast section and maintains the existing dark + cyan theme with glassy accents and subtle particle/water interactions while providing polished forms for user engagement.
